<p>I’m an AI engineer / researcher in SF.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked on LLM / recommender systems post-training and evaluations at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, and LLM fine-tuning at <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>.</p>
<p>I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I was fortunate to have collaborated with the research community from <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu">BAIR</a>, <a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/">Sky Computing Lab</a>, and <a href="https://launchpad.berkeley.edu">Launchpad</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014YOUA01">solving Rubik’s Cubes</a>, going on long bike rides, and capturing moments on my digicam/film camera.</p>
